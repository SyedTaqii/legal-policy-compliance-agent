While Section 6.8 is titled ""Force Majeure"" and refers to a definition in ""Section 2.2"" (which is not explicitly labeled in the provided context), the quoted clause provides the substantive definition and excuse for performance due to acts of God."
R06,Assignment,COMPLIANT,"Verdict: COMPLIANT
Evidence: ""6.1 Assignment. No assignment of this Agreement or any right accruing hereunder shall be made by the Distributor in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Upon the assignment of a party's interest and rights in this Agreement the assigning party shall be relieved of all further obligations imposed by this Agreement.""
Reasoning: The contract explicitly addresses assignment to third parties. It restricts assignment by the Distributor without prior written consent from the Company and specifies conditions for such consent. It also allows assignment by the Company to any person or entity meeting certain criteria."
R07,Intellectual Property,NON-COMPLIANT,"Verdict: NON-COMPLIANT
Evidence: No clause found that clarifies ownership of intellectual property created under the agreement. The existing clauses mention ""intellectual property rights of third parties"" and ""violation... of the patent, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights"" in the context of indemnification, but do not define ownership of IP between the contracting parties.
Reasoning: The contract mentions intellectual property in the context of third-party rights and indemnification for violations, but it fails to include a clause that explicitly clarifies who owns intellectual property created by the parties during the term of the agreement."

Evidence: No clause found
Reasoning: The provided contract clauses do not contain a specific section or statement regarding 'Dispute Resolution' that specifies arbitration, mediation, or litigation as the method for resolving disputes between the parties.

R10,Liability Cap,NON-COMPLIANT,"Verdict: NON-COMPLIANT
Evidence: No clause found
Reasoning: The provided contract clauses discuss indemnification, product liability insurance, and the relationship between parties, which all relate to liability in a general sense. However, there is no specific clause that establishes a 'Liability Cap' by limiting liability to a specific monetary amount, as required by the rule."
R11,Non-Compete,COMPLIANT,"Verdict: COMPLIANT
Evidence: ""nor will Distributor solicit any customer or potential customer of Company to purchase a competitive product during that period.""
Reasoning: Clause 5.7 (B) explicitly restricts the Distributor from soliciting customers to purchase competitive products, which constitutes a restriction on competing with the Company."
R12,Non-Solicit,COMPLIANT,"Verdict: COMPLIANT
Evidence: ""5.7 Nonsolicitation. (A) During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, the Distributor (on behalf of itself, each of its affiliates and each of their respective representatives) agrees that it will not directly or indirectly solicit or hire any executive, managerial or technical employee of the Company or any of its affiliates. (B) Distributor further agrees that it will not interfere with or otherwise disrupt the business relations between the Company or nay of its affiliates and any of their current or prospective customers, suppliers or distributors, during the Term of the Agreement and for a period of eighteen (18) months thereafter, nor will Distributor solicit any customer or potential customer of Company to purchase a competitive product during that period.""
Reasoning: The contract contains a specific clause, ""5.7 Nonsolicitation,"" which explicitly restricts the Distributor from soliciting or hiring employees (part A) and from interfering with or soliciting customers (part B) of the Company, thereby satisfying the rule."
R13,Severability,NON-COMPLIANT,"Verdict: NON-COMPLIANT
Evidence: No clause found
Reasoning: The provided contract clauses do not contain a provision specifically addressing severability, which would state that if one part of the agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts shall continue in full force and effect."
R14,Entire Agreement,COMPLIANT,"Verdict: COMPLIANT
Evidence: 6.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with all exhibits attached hereto which are hereby incorporated by reference, supersedes any and all other agreements, either oral or written, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains of the covenants and agreements between the parties with respect to said matter. This Agreement may not be altered, amended or modified, except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto.
Reasoning: Clause 6.5 is titled ""Entire Agreement"" and explicitly states that ""This Agreement... supersedes any and all other agreements, either oral or written,"" which directly satisfies the rule's requirement."
R15,Waiver,COMPLIANT,"Verdict: COMPLIANT
Evidence: ""6.2 Nonwaiver of Rights. Failure of either party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or any rights with respect thereto or failure to exercise any election provided for herein shall in no way be a waiver of such provisions, rights or elections or in any way affect the validity of this Agreement. The failure of either party to exercise any of said provisions, rights or elections shall not preclude or prejudice such party from later enforcing or exercising the same or any other provisions, rights or elections which is may have under this Agreement.""
Reasoning: The clause explicitly states that the ""Failure of either party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or any rights with respect thereto... shall in no way be a waiver of such provisions, rights or elections"". It further clarifies that such failure ""shall not preclude or prejudice such party from later enforcing or exercising the same"", directly satisfying the rule that failure to enforce a right does not waive that right."
